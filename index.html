                    <p>Gurren Lagann is an anime I watched in 2009, a year after it was released. This word would mean nothing in English to be honest, since it is a Japanese word. With Gurren meaning red and Lagann meaning face, together. Gurren is the name of a bigger mecha that the character Kamina controls while Lagann is the name of the smaller mecha that Simon controls. Together, they combine into Gurren Lagann. Gurren Lagann is an anime about a boy trying to break through limits; after finding a buried robot underground, he and the mecha explore new horizons, make new friends, and confront new enemies. From living underground to reaching the surface, and ultimately traveling to the edge of the universe.</p>
                    <p>I consider this to be one of my core memories and a defining aspect of who I am. Gurren Lagann isn't just about mecha and friendship powers. It has taught me important lessons about persistence, coping with loss, and seeking out loved ones even to the ends of the universe. Gurren Lagann has sparked my love for mecha/robots, astronomy, and flying to the skies.</p>

                    <p>Ever since I was a kid, and after watching Gurren Lagann, I have been fascinated with the skies and space. Living in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, I did not have many opportunities to observe clear night skies. The Bortle scale measures light pollution, with level 9 representing city lights (like in Hanoi) and level 1 referring to a perfectly dark sky, typically found in remote places like mountains or national parks. To truly see the stars, I would need to be in a low Bortle zone, which is not possible in a bustling city like Hanoi.</p>
                    <p>However, despite the light pollution, Hanoi offered me some of the most stunning sunsets I could ever ask for. I was fortunate enough to capture some pictures of the sunset in my hometown. After studying abroad at Michigan State University, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to participate in numerous astronomy events, such as visiting the planetarium to watch sky simulations in a dome or going to the MSU Observatory to observe space and extraterrestrial objects through a telescope.</p>
